## A chessboard was apparently not dramatic enough

OpenMove started with a random YouTube video I cannot find anymore.

Somewhere between that and the magical chessboard from *Harry Potter*, I got stuck on a question: could I make a real chessboard that understood what was happening on it, thought about the next move, and physically moved a piece back?

Not a finished product. Not even a particularly sensible first project idea. Just a very specific kind of curiosity that refused to leave.

I had been into open source software for a while, so the name **OpenMove** felt right.

## Getting into BIR

I was sitting in a regular, boring college lab when I started randomly trying to join different TinkerHub groups.

Somehow, even after registrations had closed, I got into the BIR WhatsApp group. Shann, one of the admins, contacted me, heard the project idea, and let me join BIR properly.

That was how OpenMove accidentally became a Builder-in-Residence project.

At that point, OpenMove was still mostly a concept. There was no assembled board, no tested mechanism, and definitely no tiny wizard living under the chessboard moving pieces around.

But it was enough of an idea to explore properly.

## The first technical sketch

The first version in my head had three main parts:

* An 8×8 grid of Hall-effect sensors — one for each square — to detect piece positions.
* A local Stockfish chess engine to calculate a response.
* An automated mechanism underneath the board to move chess pieces.

The practical details were not simple at all.

How would the board distinguish pieces reliably? How would a mechanism move across all 64 squares without getting stuck, losing position, or dragging pieces it was not supposed to touch? Could magnets move a piece through the board cleanly? Could the electronics, mechanics, and chess logic be kept separate enough that debugging one did not destroy the others?

At this stage, those were questions — not solved engineering decisions.

## Why I wanted to explore it

OpenMove was interesting because it sat right at the intersection of things I wanted to learn: electronics, mechanical design, embedded control, chess logic, and software that has consequences in the physical world.

A chess engine returning a move in software is normal. A board physically carrying that move out is where it gets complicated.

That seemed like a good reason to try it.

## What came next

The next step was to turn the vague sketch into smaller experiments: decide how the XY mechanism might work, identify the controller and motion hardware, and validate movement before pretending the board could play chess.

Because a brilliant chess engine is not very useful if the board responds by launching a knight into another dimension.
